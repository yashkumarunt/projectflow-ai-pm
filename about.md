# About ProjectFlow

**Author:** Yash Kumar Lal Das

**What it is:**  
ProjectFlow is an **AI Project Management** assistant built with **Amazon PartyRock** and **Amazon Bedrock**. It converts a simple backlog into:
- A **Kanban board** (To-Do / In-Progress / Blocked / Done)
- A **capacity-aware sprint plan** (by assignee & day)
- A **JSON** representation (for saving and integrations)

**Why I built it:**  
To demonstrate **prompt engineering**, **operational thinking (WIP limits)**, and a **clean data model** that can extend into AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway).

**Skills shown:**  
- **Cloud (AWS)** – architecture planning and Free Tier awareness  
- **AI (LLM)** – prompt design and deterministic outputs  
- **PM (Project Management)** – prioritization, capacity planning, risk/next actions  
- **Data** – stable **JSON schema** for integration
